/**
 * @file demo_vcam.h
 * @brief Virtual camera implementation: Annex-B sample -> AU index -> cyclic
 *        frame feed at the configured frame rate.
 *
 * The video source is a file: the whole file is read into memory (the bundled
 * video is about 4.3MB), NAL units are located by Annex-B start codes, and an
 * AU index is built; a vcam thread delivers AUs on a 1000/fps ms tick, using
 * absolute timestamps for drift correction (no accumulated sleep error), and
 * loops back to frame 0 at end of file. demo_vcam_request_i_frame() makes the
 * next tick jump to the next IDR AU. demo_vcam_set_bitrate() switches to a
 * pre-encoded variant at the next tick (resuming on an IDR), so the demo can
 * follow the P2P rate control like a real encoder. close() waits for the
 * thread to exit before freeing the buffer; a timed-out close marks the
 * instance poisoned and refuses a reopen (leak instead of use-after-free).
 *
 * All variants must use the same resolution/profile/fps/GOP and be I/P-only
 * (no B-frames), with SPS/PPS repeated at every IDR; the demo timestamps AUs
 * in decode order, so B-frames make playback jump.
 *
 * AU splitting rules (works with and without AUD; the bundled demo_video.264
 * has no AUD):
 *   - an AUD (NAL type 9) starts a new AU (the AUD belongs to the new AU)
 *   - a VCL NAL (type 1..5) starts a new AU when the current AU already has a VCL
 *   - other non-VCL NALs (SPS/PPS/SEI) belong to the current AU
 *   - a type 5 NAL (IDR) inside an AU sets is_i_frame = TRUE
 *   - one VCL per AU is assumed (multi-slice streams are out of scope)
 *
 * The frame callback runs on the vcam thread and must not block for long
 * (the demo side copies the frame into its queue); frame->data points into the
 * vcam internal buffer and is only valid during the callback.
